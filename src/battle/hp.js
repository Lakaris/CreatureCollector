// Applying damage to a unit's Health.
//
// POLICY: every point of damage dealt to a unit goes through damageUnit --
// basic attacks, ability modules, boss actions, minion specials, DoTs, and
// reflects alike -- so a Shield always absorbs before Health is touched.
// Never subtract from `.hp` directly anywhere else.
//
// An ability may bypass the Shield ONLY when its own displayed text says so,
// by passing {pierceShield: true}. Nothing does today; adding one means
// writing it in the ability's text first.
//
// The boss's own separate shield pool is handled by damageBoss in damage.js.
//
// This lives in its own module (rather than in status.js beside the Shield
// timer, or in damage.js beside the damage formulas) so that status.js and
// damage.js can both use it without an import cycle.
